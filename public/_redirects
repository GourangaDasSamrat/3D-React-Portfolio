# --- Netlify Redirects for GourangaDas.netlify.app ---

# 1. Canonicalization: Redirect 'www' to non-'www' version
#    This ensures all traffic goes to your preferred URL (gourangadas.netlify.app).
#    It's a permanent 301 redirect, which is great for SEO.
https://www.gourangadas.netlify.app/* https://gourangadas.netlify.app/:splat 301!

# 2. SPA Fallback / Client-side Routing
#    This rule is CRUCIAL for React/Vite (Single Page Applications) on Netlify.
#    It tells Netlify that if a requested path doesn't match a file,
#    it should serve your index.html (your main React app), but return a 200 OK status.
#    This allows your React Router to then handle the URL (e.g., /about, /projects).
/* /index.html 200

# 3. Optional: Ensure all HTTP requests redirect to HTTPS (Netlify usually handles this automatically)
#    You generally don't need this line, as Netlify provides HTTPS by default.
# http://* https://:splat 301!
